# Kubernetes Cluster Setup and Sample Application Deployment

## Setting up a Kubernetes Cluster using Minikube

1. Install Minikube:
   Follow the instructions on the [Minikube installation guide](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/).

2. Start Minikube:
   ```sh
   minikube start
   ```

3. Verify Minikube is running:
   ```sh
   minikube status
   ```

## Deploying a Sample Application to the Cluster

1. Create a deployment:
   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
   ```

2. Create a service:
   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml
   ```

## Verifying the Cluster and Application Deployment

1. Check the deployment status:
   ```sh
   kubectl get deployments
   ```

2. Check the service status:
   ```sh
   kubectl get services
   ```

3. Access the application:
   ```sh
   minikube service <service-name>
   ```

Replace `<service-name>` with the name of your service.

## Integrating Generative AI Models

1. Develop or integrate generative AI models using frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Hugging Face.

2. Package the model into a Docker container:
   ```sh
   # Example Dockerfile
   FROM python:3.8-slim

   RUN pip install tensorflow torch transformers

   COPY . /app
   WORKDIR /app

   CMD ["python", "your_model_script.py"]
   ```

3. Build and push the Docker image to a container registry:
   ```sh
   docker build -t your-registry/your-model:latest .
   docker push your-registry/your-model:latest
   ```

## Deploying Generative AI Models as Services within the Kubernetes Cluster

1. Create a deployment for the generative AI model:
   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f k8s/ai-model-deployment.yaml
   ```

2. Create a service for the generative AI model:
   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f k8s/ai-model-service.yaml
   ```

3. Verify the deployment and service:
   ```sh
   kubectl get deployments
   kubectl get services
   ```

4. Access the generative AI model service:
   ```sh
   minikube service <ai-model-service-name>
   ```

Replace `<ai-model-service-name>` with the name of your AI model service.
